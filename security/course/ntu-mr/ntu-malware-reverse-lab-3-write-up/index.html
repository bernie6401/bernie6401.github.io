Name 何秉學 StuID R11921A16 Review Packing and Unpacking How does packing and unpacking work? 作者會把原本的code section和data section，放在UPX1，並且用unpacking stub(裡面存放解殼的程式)，把UPX1的內容一點一點的還原回UPX0(也就是空區段)，並跳回正常程式的執行進入點(original entry point, OEP)，最後跳回去的動作叫做Tail Jump或Long Jump，另外，多長的jump才是長，可能要依照經驗值判斷，或是直接跳過去後分析程式在幹嘛 實際上執行脫殼的時候，除了OEP的重建外，還需要重建Imports，這兩者都處理好後才算是脫殼完成 當分析脫殼執行到如下圖這樣的情況時，就離終點不遠了，也就是jmp的地址離目前的程式很遠，且之後的程式有很多空指令或垃圾byte，此為UXP殼的特徵 可以用PEiD這個工具(或是用Entropy之類的，但是不一定準確)判斷樣本有沒有加殼，或是加了甚麼殼，上圖是沒有加殼的一般程式，下圖是加了UPX的加殼程式 若是要處理Import Table Reconstruction，可以用OllyDump、ImpRec或是Scylla這些工具來進行，在Practice中是用Scylla演示(且可以搭配x32dbg或x64dbg進行) 老師有說在Long Jump之前會搭配pop instruction，這可能可以當作解析OEP的線索 Tail Jump，不一定是用jmp，也可以是call instruction；另外，跳轉的地址也不一定是一個明確的地址，也可能用暫存器存起來，這部分可以注意一下 Practice - upx_exercise.exe Observation First things first, we can observe the file by executing it directly. Obviously, you should enter correct CTF key by analyzing. Unpacking Static analysis - IDA Pro You are not allowed to disassembly by doing nothing, because it was packed by UPX. Therefore, our objective is to unpack it and try to analyze it original code to get the CTF Flag. Dynamic analysis - x32dbg In UPX-based packing, it has a feature that in order to not let the data be flushed during unpacking, it must store all data to the stack by using pushad instruction. Then, you’ll see a lot of jmp instruction to unpack the original code. Scrolling down the code, you’ll see a popad instruction at 0x0134AEDE , a jmp instruction at 0x010EAEEC, and a lots of null instruction which all three are satisfied all features that UPX-based packing method has. It’ll restore all data that stored in stack and jump to upx_exercise.134244D. Set the break-point and press run button in x32dbg, then press step into button to observe the code. Now, the code has already unpacked, then we can use Scylla to do Import Reconstruction. Press IAT Autosearch(Import Address Table) button to search and then press Get Imports button. Finally, you will get all imports that this file used, and Scylla will help you to rebuild it. Press Dump button to get IAT file. Press Fix Dump and choose the file what we dump to reconnect the IAT and this file. You’ll see the log said Import Rebuild success and you’ll get a new file named upx_exercise_dump_SCY.exe that repaired by Scylla. Analyze Re-static analysis - IDA Pro Used IDA to reanalyze the unpacking file. Used string searching to find the string nope that appear in your cmd. Used cross reference to find which part has used it. The main part is shown as below ... sub_E01EB0(std::cin, &amp;Memory); LOBYTE(v116) = 1; MEMORY[0] = 0; v96 = 0xFCC1D3C4; v97 = 0xD8D2C8DE; v98 = 0xD8D3E8E0; v99 = 0xD8C2EFB0; v100 = 0xC2ECB3C1; v101 = 0xB3EBE1D8; v102 = 0xD5F3D8BE; v103 = 0xB3EFD8DE; v104 = 0xF5C2E3D5; v105 = 0xFAD6D6D8; v64 = 1; HIBYTE(v95) = 1; v65 = 0; v93 = 0; while ( v65 < 40 ) { v66 = (char *)&amp;Memory; if ( v111 >= 16 ) v66 = (char *)Memory; v67 = v66[v65] ^ 0x87; v68 = *((unsigned __int8 *)&amp;v96 + v65); v94 = 0; if ( v67 != v68 ) v64 = v94; HIBYTE(v95) = v64; v93 = ++v65; } v69 = "Congratz?!"; if ( !v64 ) v69 = "Nope!"; ... From v96 to v105, it stored 40 bytes and it seems do something in while loop 40 times. In addition, v67 = v66[v65] ^ 0x87; this line used xor instruction that seems a encrypt part. And then it compared &amp;v96 + v65 and v67 that encrypt the string what you input. If all the strings you input after process xor to 0x87 are strictly the same with v96 to v105, then it’ll print Congratz?!, otherwise, print Nope. Used online_xor to get v96 to v105 encrypted strings. And then used online_hex2ascii to get the CTF Flag. The answer is **CTF{YOU_goT_7hE_F4kE_fl49_tRY_h4RdEr_QQ}**, though it is not a real answer. Note that, the demo from TA is finished, therefore, I still don’t know the real flag is. Homework - upx_Revil.exe Static Analysis Observation Use IDA to analyze this sample and obviously packed sample Use the skill above then you can answer the question easily.

作者會把原本的code section和data section，放在UPX1，並且用unpacking stub(裡面存放解殼的程式)，把UPX1的內容一點一點的還原回UPX0(也就是空區段)，並跳回正常程式的執行進入點(original entry point, <code>OEP</code>)，最後跳回去的動作叫做<code>Tail Jump</code>或<code>Long Jump</code>，另外，多長的jump才是長，可能要依照經驗值判斷，或是直接跳過去後分析程式在幹嘛
