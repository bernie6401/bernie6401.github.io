So, we must create new datatype in Datt Type Manager.

Then do the same thing as above that what we do to analyze wannacry file such as change WinMain signature or renamee variable or retype variable, etc.</li><li>While you&rsquo;re analyzing in WinMain function, you&rsquo;ll see a strange variable &_Str2_0040f538 which store &lsquo;/i&rsquo; characters. You can just press &lsquo;c&rsquo; in assembly code to show &lsquo;\i&rsquo;.</li><li>Next, scroll down this file, you&rsquo;ll see a strange swprintf parameter called _Count_0040f40c. Then select all addr type data and right click mouse and select <strong>clear with option</strong>. You&rsquo;ll see many unicode strings. Finally, right click DAT_0040f40c and choose Data/TerminatedUnicode.</li><li>Finally, you can check this figure to know the whole operation flow <a href=#R-image-03772ae314eb4a2a24f87e44504ff8e5 class=lightbox-link><img alt="whole flow chart of wannacry" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=https://imgur.com/P00ObJZ.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
