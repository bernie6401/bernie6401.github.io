## Ping two machine in internal mode
:::spoiler Detailed Process
1. Clone another VM

Setting 2 VMs' network config as above.
**Note that**, must check MAC address is different, promiscuous mode is `Allow All` and the adapter is the same.
3. Check ifconfig

## Test Communication between bridged VMs on Different Hosts
:::spoiler Detailed Process
1. Setting Bridged Adapter of each VM

**Note that**, the adapter must be the same.
2. Check ifconfig

## Reconstruct ARP cache by iteratively PING all subnet IP addresses
Objective: scanning all the machine in the same LAN

### Note
DO NOT EXECUTE IN DORM... YOU'LL BE BANNED...

### Source Code
```bash=
#!/bin/bash

# ping all ip addresses in the local network
for ip in 192.168.0.{1..254}; do
	# delete old arp records
	sudo arp -d $ip > /dev/null 2>&1
	# get new arp info by ping
	ping -c 5 $ip > /dev/null 2>&1 &
done

# wait for all ping processes to finish
wait

# show scan results (arp table)
arp -n | grep -v incomplete
```

### Detailed Process
:::spoiler Detailed Process
1. Setting to Host-Only Adapter

2. Check ifconfig
It should be the same as your real machine

3. Setting the code
    ```bash=
    $ sudo dos2unix arpscan.sh
    $ sudo chmod 777 arpscan.sh
    $ vim arpscan.sh
    # modify the sub-ip as the same as your real machine, i.e. 192.168.56.{1..254}
    $ sudo bash arpscan.sh
    ```

## Testing Communication between VMs on Different Hosts using NAT
Objective: Find another physical computer and open web service on each PC then use port forwarding to connect the web service to each other.

:::spoiler Detailed Process
1. Find another physical computer and connect your own network
2. Set to NAT mode
![](https://i.imgur.com/S0DlK7c.png)
3. Check your physical computer and VM's ip
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/TXTh6SE.png)

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/g3eoBft.png)
4. Turn off VM and set port forwarding
![](https://i.imgur.com/bZA3dYz.png)
5. Open your web service
    ```bash!
    $ sudo service apache2 start
    ```
    Then test if the service is open or not in local host
