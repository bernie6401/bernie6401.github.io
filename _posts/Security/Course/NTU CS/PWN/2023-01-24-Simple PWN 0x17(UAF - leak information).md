## Original Code
```cpp!=
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    void *p1, *p2;
    p1 = malloc(0x30);
    p2 = malloc(0x30);

    free(p1);
    free(p2);

    puts(p2);
}
```
If we set the pointer to `NULL` after it was freed, then we can get some vital info. from this chunk.

## Analyze
* After malloc all pointer

* After free `p1`

* After free `p2`, the data section will transfer to store metadata, and `fd` store the address of `p1` header

* Thus, we print out the value of `p2`, we will leak something if it wasn't set `NULL` after it was freed
